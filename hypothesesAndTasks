Thesis hypotheses:

Linkage disequilibrium of male and female S-locus specificities 
Non-synonymous mutations in S-RNAse
Characterize proportion of S-locus genes present in sequence capture data by discovering as many S-locus genes as possible using NGSgenotyp
Estimate migration using populations along environmental gradients
Migration rates of S-locus compared to neutral loci
Self compatibility in the species
Advantages of selfing in colonization

Tasks for data preparation:

Filter VCF by bed region for SI genes
Separate VCFs by valleys
Map distances between sub-population latitudes and longitudes
Measure FST, pi, Tajima's D along environmental gradients
Ancestral Recombination Graphs to infer neutrality (Hejase, Dukler, Siepel)
FILTER LOCI FOR NEUTRALITY USING DESIGN OF CHRISTMAS, BIFFIN, REED, LOWE
Find potential duplications of S-locus through negative F^IS values, indicates higher heterozygosity than HWE, potentially recombining S-genes/self compat.
PLINK LD tool to associate F-Box loci with S-RNase
Identify ancestral alleles conserved from related species using public S-locus data
Search for monophyly of S-alleles in marginal populations
